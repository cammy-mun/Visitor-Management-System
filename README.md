This is a Visitor Management System designed for Farrer Park Hospital, especially during this Covid-19 period.

We decided to implement several technologies such as a thermometer cum facial detection machine which makes use of Computer Vision to detect faces. Hence, this will serve as a record of who are the visitors to the hospital that day.

Our ideas also include using QR codes to determine entry into the ward. Visitors can only enter the level and ward of the patient that they are visiting. They have to show the QR code that was given to them after registration of particulars to the QR code scanner. If allowed, the doors/turnstile will be unlocked or they will be able to press the lift button to that level. (Similar to how hotel key cards can only access that specific level)
